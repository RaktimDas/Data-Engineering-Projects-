## Introduction

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. It covers each stage from data ingestion to processing and finally to storage, utilizing a robust tech stack that includes Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. Everything is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.

## System Architecture

The project is designed with the following components:

- **Data Source**: We use `randomuser.me` API to generate random user data for our pipeline.
- **Apache Airflow**: Responsible for orchestrating the pipeline and storing fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Used for streaming data from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Helps in monitoring and schema management of our Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: For data processing with its master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Where the processed data will be stored.

## Learnings 

- Setting up a data pipeline with Apache Airflow
- Real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka
- Distributed synchronization with Apache Zookeeper
- Data processing techniques with Apache Spark
- Data storage solutions with Cassandra and PostgreSQL
- Containerizing your entire data engineering setup with Docker

## Technologies

- Apache Airflow
- Python
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Zookeeper
- Apache Spark
- Cassandra
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

**Executions** :
-Terminal - Downloading the Docker Images and Setting Up the Container 
           Code: **Docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d**
After the Container is up and running, the ports are exposed and we can access the required services.
-Step 1: Confluent is opened up.
-Step 2: Airflow DAG (Data Acyclic Graph) and the dag is run and the data is processed into the Kafka topic.
-Step 3: On Parallel the spark application runs the data frame the streaming is started and the data starts to get ingested into the Cassandra table.
